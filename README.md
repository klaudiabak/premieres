The app is used to keep abreast of upcoming movie premieres.
At the moment this is a test version of the application, in the future I plan to expand it with the following elements: 
- A list of upcoming premieres available to all users, 
- Movie recommendations based on the titles you add, 
- Movie details such as cast, description, reviews, trailers and ratings,
- Premiere Calendar - ability to add premiere dates to the calendar and set a reminder for upcoming premieres,
- Favorite Movies - ability to save your favorite movies and receive notifications about their updates and premieres,
- Notifications about the latest movie updates and premieres,
- Ability to view other users' reviews and ratings and add your own reviews and ratings,
- Movie trailers - possibility to watch and comment together with other users
